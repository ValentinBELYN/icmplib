    '''
    Determine the route to a destination host.

    The Internet is a large and complex aggregation of network hardware,
    connected together by gateways. Tracking the route one's packets
    follow can be difficult. This function uses the IP protocol time to
    live field and attempts to elicit an ICMP Time Exceeded response
    from each gateway along the path to some host.

    This function requires root privileges to run.

    :type address: str
    :param address: The IP address, hostname or FQDN of the host to
        reach. For deterministic behavior, prefer to use an IP address.

    :type count: int, optional
    :param count: The number of ping to perform per hop. Default to 2.

    :type interval: int or float, optional
    :param interval: The interval in seconds between sending each
        packet. Default to 0.05.

    :type timeout: int or float, optional
    :param timeout: The maximum waiting time for receiving a reply in
        seconds. Default to 2.

    :type id: int, optional
    :param id: The identifier of ICMP requests. Used to match the
        responses with requests. In practice, a unique identifier
        should be used for every traceroute process. By default, the
        identifier corresponds to the PID.

    :type first_hop: int, optional
    :param first_hop: The first time to live used in outgoing probe
        packets. Default to 1.

    :type max_hops: int, optional
    :param max_hops: The maximum time to live used in outgoing probe
        packets. Default to 30.

    :type source: str, optional
    :param source: The IP address from which you want to send packets.
        By default, the interface is automatically chosen according to
        the specified destination.

    :type fast: bool, optional
    :param fast: When this option is enabled and an intermediate router
        has been reached, skip to the next hop rather than perform
        additional requests. The `count` parameter then becomes the
        maximum number of requests in the event of no response.
        Default to False.

    Advanced (**kwags):

    :type payload: bytes, optional
    :param payload: The payload content in bytes. A random payload is
        used by default.

    :type payload_size: int, optional
    :param payload_size: The payload size. Ignored when the `payload`
        parameter is set. Default to 56.

    :type traffic_class: int, optional
    :param traffic_class: The traffic class of ICMP packets.
        Provides a defined level of service to packets by setting the
        DS Field (formerly TOS) or the Traffic Class field of IP
        headers. Packets are delivered with the minimum priority by
        default (Best-effort delivery).
        Intermediate routers must be able to support this feature.
        Only available on Unix systems. Ignored on Windows.

    :rtype: list of Hop
    :returns: A list of `Hop` objects representing the route to the
        desired destination. The list is sorted in ascending order
        according to the distance, in terms of hops, that separates the
        remote host from the current machine. Gateways that do not
        respond to requests are not added to this list.

    :raises NameLookupError: If you pass a hostname or FQDN in
        parameters and it does not exist or cannot be resolved.
    :raises SocketPermissionError: If the privileges are insufficient
        to create the socket.
    :raises SocketAddressError: If the source address cannot be
        assigned to the socket.
    :raises ICMPSocketError: If another error occurs. See the
        `ICMPv4Socket` or `ICMPv6Socket` class for details.

    Usage::

        >>> from icmplib import traceroute
        >>> hops = traceroute('1.1.1.1')
        >>> last_distance = 0

        >>> for hop in hops:
        ...     if last_distance + 1 != hop.distance:
        ...         print('Some gateways are not responding')
        ...
        ...     print(f'{hop.distance} {hop.address} {hop.avg_rtt} ms')
        ...
        ...     last_distance = hop.distance
        ...

        2       194.149.169.49      7.552 ms

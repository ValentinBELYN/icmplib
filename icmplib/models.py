class ICMPRequest:
    '''
    A user-created object that represents an ICMP ECHO_REQUEST.

    :type destination: str
    :param destination: The IP address of the gateway or host to which
        the message should be sent.

    :type id: int
    :param id: The identifier of the request. Used to match the reply
        with the request. In practice, a unique identifier is used for
        every ping process.

    :type sequence: int
    :param sequence: The sequence number. Used to match the reply with
        the request. Typically, the sequence number is incremented for
        each packet sent during the process.

    :type payload: bytes
    :param payload: (Optional) The payload content in bytes. A random
        payload is used by default.

    :type payload_size: int
    :param payload_size: (Optional) The payload size. Ignored when the
        `payload` parameter is set.

    :type timeout: int or float
    :param timeout: (Optional) The maximum waiting time for receiving
        the reply in seconds.

    :type ttl: int
    :param ttl: (Optional) The time to live of the packet in seconds.

    :type traffic_class: int
    :param traffic_class: (Optional) The traffic class of the packet.
        Provides a defined level of service to the packet by setting
        the DS Field (formerly TOS) or the Traffic Class field of the
        IP header. Packets are delivered with the minimum priority by
        default (Best-effort delivery).
        Intermediate routers must be able to support this feature.
        Only available on Unix systems. Ignored on Windows.

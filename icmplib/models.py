class ICMPRequest:
    '''
    A user-created object that represents an ICMP Echo Request.

    :type destination: str
    :param destination: The IP address of the host to which the message
        should be sent.

    :type id: int
    :param id: The identifier of the request. Used to match the reply
        with the request. In practice, a unique identifier is used for
        every ping process. On Linux, this identifier is automatically
        replaced if the request is sent from an unprivileged socket.

    :type sequence: int
    :param sequence: The sequence number. Used to match the reply with
        the request. Typically, the sequence number is incremented for
        each packet sent during the process.

    :type payload: bytes, optional
    :param payload: The payload content in bytes. A random payload is
        used by default.

    :type payload_size: int, optional
    :param payload_size: The payload size. Ignored when the `payload`
        parameter is set. Default to 56.

    :type ttl: int, optional
    :param ttl: The time to live of the packet in terms of hops.
        Default to 64.

    :type traffic_class: int, optional
    :param traffic_class: The traffic class of the ICMP packet.
        Provides a defined level of service to the packet by setting the
        DS Field (formerly TOS) or the Traffic Class field of the IP
        header. Packets are delivered with the minimum priority by
        default (Best-effort delivery).
        Intermediate routers must be able to support this feature.
        Only available on Unix systems. Ignored on Windows.

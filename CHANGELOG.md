- Add support for IPv6 addresses with zone index.
- The `payload` property of an `ICMPRequest` now returns a random value if the payload is not defined instead of `None`.
- Optimize imports.

## [v3.0.1](https://github.com/ValentinBELYN/icmplib/releases/tag/v3.0.1) - 2021-08-14
- Make the `SocketPermissionError` more explicit when the OS does not allow instantiation of unprivileged sockets.
- Delete unnecessary properties from exceptions.

## [v3.0.0](https://github.com/ValentinBELYN/icmplib/releases/tag/v3.0.0) - 2021-06-01
**icmplib 3.0 is here! :rocket:**

- The library is now asynchronous!
  - Introduce new functions: `async_ping`, `async_multiping` and `async_resolve`.
  - Add a new `AsyncSocket` class to make an ICMP socket asynchronous.
- Rewrite models:
  - All the properties of `Host` and `Hop` classes are now lazy.
  - Add new properties to the `Host` and `Hop` classes: you can retrieve the list of round-trip times and calculate the jitter.
  - Add the metaclass `__str__` to visualize the results more easily.
- Rewrite the `ping`, `multiping` and `traceroute` functions:
  - The identifier of ICMP requests is now handled automatically by the library.
  - Add the ability to set the address family if a hostname or an FQDN is specified.
  - A new implementation is used for the `multiping` function. It should be more reliable.
  - The `multiping` function is now in a dedicated module.
- Rewrite the documentation to help you get started with icmplib.
- Improve the `resolve` function to return all IP addresses found.
- Add the `is_hostname` function to check if a string is a hostname or an FQDN.
- Delete the experimental class `BufferedSocket`, replaced by `AsyncSocket`.
- Performance and compatibility improvement.
- Many other small changes and fixes.
